<h1>Hi!</h1>

<p style="max-width: 900px;">
	I make software whenever I feel like it. You can you use it, as long as you give me credit. (If
	you do actually find a use for the stuff I've made please let me know.) I am <b>not</b>
	responsible if you manage to mess up your computer with my programs. Most of the software I provide
	is free and licensed under GPLv3, so use it at your own risk. Regardless, please enjoy this new version
	of my landing page.
	<br /><br />
	Regards,
	<br /><br />
